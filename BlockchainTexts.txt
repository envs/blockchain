Smart contracts are digital contracts stored on a blockchain that are automatically executed when predetermined T&Cs are met.
They are typically used to AUTOMATE the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, 
without any intermediary's involvement or time loss.
They can also AUTOMATE a workflow, triggering the next action when conditions are met.
